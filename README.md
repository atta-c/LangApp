# LangApp
I introduce you my first software application for learning language. If you want to use, create the file "questions.txt", in current program's files folder. Write at first line word what u want to translate and the second one line put the answer (or repeat). Build.

v1.00
-Changed language code for english
-Changed structure code for learning language
-Automated amount of arrays
-Automated amount of questions

The source code is from https://miroslawzelent.pl/pliki/obiektowy_cpp_odc2.zip, by Miros≈Çaw Zelent. The code is asking about the questions in *.txt file (like millioners). For single question the file should contain line by line: 1.Qustion, 2.Answer A, 3.Answer B, 4.Answer C, 5.Answer D, 6.Letter of correct answer.
